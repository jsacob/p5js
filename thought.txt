okay i thought the rotation was wrong at first but according to
keplers first law the planets don't revolve in a perfect cirular pattern
but in an elliptical orbit so that makes me think this is competely fine

on the other node if i remove the velocity the planets fall directly
into the sun which is another good sign that I implemented this correctly

also I need to learn how to implement collision and moons that can rotate
around each planet which i think should be pretty straight forward i hope so? i don't know.


also all my planets have a mass of 1 so the planet mass of the planets aren't completed yet


wait i read somewhere that the kinematic formula im using v_i = v_0 + a*t isn't the best pick for velocity because it's used for velocity linearlly

however i found two new formulas i could apply to get a much better result
1. which will get us our velocity instead: v = sqrt(G*M_central) / r
2  new acceleration formula: a = (G*M_central) / r^2

now im not completely sure if these are correct but ill try anyways.
