okay i thought the rotation was wrong at first but according to
keplers first law the planets don't revolve in a perfect cirular pattern
but in an elliptical orbit so that makes me think this is competely fine

on the other node if i remove the velocity the planets fall directly
into the sun which is another good sign that I implemented this correctly

also I need to learn how to implement collision and moons that can rotate
around each planet which i think should be pretty straight forward i hope so? i don't know.
