F = G (m1*m2/r^2)

where G is the constant of 6.6743 * 10^−11
where m1 is the mass of the sun and m2 is the mass of venus
where r^2 is the distance between both


lets say m1 = 10kg and m2 = 20kg

and r = 2 m
use pytha theorm to calculate the distance bewtween two x and y's

so to solve

10 * 20 = 200
distance between sun x and y and mercury x and y

F = (6.6743 * 10^-11) * 50



okay i don't fully understand how to implement this in code might take me awhile to make this work

search how to apply force formula
when you get your outcome


 can remove the speed because the speed is determined by the mass and the distance between planets
^ im leaving this shameful thought here, obviously there is speed.

formula: D = sqrt(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2

planet 1 = x: 20, y: 40
planet 2 = x:50, y: 70

D = sqrt(50-20)^2 + (70-40)^2

D = sqrt 30^2+ 30^2

D = sqrt 900 + 900

D = sqrt 1800

D = 42.43

10,000
2500


weight (N) is the gravitational force on an object
Mass(kg) is the amount of matter in a body

g = (GM/r^2) <-- only use if you are calcuating rotaton of one simple planet because the weight of the smaller planet doesn't matter... i think

Keep in mind that weight and mass mean different things in Physics. If the weight of an object is given in N (Newtons), then divide it by 9.8 to get the equivalent mass


refined approach

- first calculate the distance between both objects d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y-2 - y-1)^2)

- get gravitational force F = G(m_1 * m_2) / r^2

- get accleration a = F/m
