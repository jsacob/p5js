F = G (m1*m2/r^2)

where G is the constant of 6.6743 * 10^−11
where m1 is the mass of the sun and m2 is the mass of venus
where r^2 is the distance between both


lets say m1 = 10kg and m2 = 20kg

and r = 2 m
use pytha theorm to calculate the distance bewtween two x and y's

so to solve

10 * 20 = 200
distance between sun x and y and mercury x and y

F = (6.6743 * 10^-11) * 50



okay i don't fully understand how to implement this in code might take me awhile to make this work

search how to apply force formula
when you get your outcome


i can remove the speed because the speed is determined by the mass and the distance between planets
